This function returns a N-by-d matrix, where each row represents a sample of a random      vector that is uniformly distributed on a d-dimensional unit sphere. This function is based on Brauchart, Johann S., Josef Dick, and Lou Fang.      \"Spatial low-discrepancy sequences, spherical cone discrepancy,      and applications in financial modeling.\"       Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 286 (2015): 28-53.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
